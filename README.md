## About Jeep

Jeep is an American automobile brand and division of Stellantis (formerly part of Chrysler). The brand is known for its lineup of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and off-road vehicles, with a rich heritage dating back to World War II.

## Generations

### Early Military Origins (1941-1945)
The original Jeep was developed as a light military 4Ã—4 vehicle for World War II. The Willys MB, manufactured by Willys-Overland, became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States military and its allies during World War II. Its design influenced all future Jeep vehicles and established a legacy of rugged capability.

### Civilian Jeep Era (1945-1986)
After World War II, Willys-Overland began producing the Civilian Jeep (CJ) series for the public market. The CJ models maintained the military Jeep's core characteristics while adapting to civilian use. During this period, Jeep went through several corporate owners, including Kaiser and AMC, expanding its lineup with models like the Jeepster, Wagoneer, and Cherokee.

### Chrysler Acquisition Era (1987-2013)
Chrysler purchased American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987, acquiring the Jeep brand. Under Chrysler, Jeep underwent significant modernization while maintaining its off-road heritage. This period saw the introduction of the Grand Cherokee, the continuation of the Wrangler (replacing the CJ series), and expansion into more road-oriented SUVs like the Liberty and Compass.

### FCA and Stellantis Era (2014-Present)
Following Chrysler's merger with Fiat to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and later Stellantis, Jeep has experienced global expansion and product diversification. The modern Jeep lineup ranges from compact crossovers to full-size SUVs, with the Wrangler continuing as the brand's iconic flagship. Recent innovations include plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) technology with the 4xe models and the reintroduction of the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer as premium full-size SUVs.
